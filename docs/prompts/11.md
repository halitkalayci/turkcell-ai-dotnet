User: Şu an tüm servisler 5000 portunda çalışmaya çalışıyor `dotnet run` komutu her servisi 5000,5001 gibi incremental çalıştıracak yapıya geçirelim. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll outline a small TODO plan and propose the file changes for your approval before editing.

Plan: make dotnet run auto-pick the next free port starting at 5000 for each service. I’ll add a tiny shared helper in Core and wire it in both services’ Program.cs, while still letting ASPNETCORE_URLS/--urls override.

Proposed file changes (awaiting your approval):
- Add: src/TurkcellAI.Core/Infrastructure/Hosting/PortAllocator.cs
  - Provides `GetAvailablePort(int basePort = 5000)` that scans 5000, 5001, … and returns the first free port.
  - No external dependencies; uses `TcpListener` to probe availability.
  - Exposes a simple method to set Kestrel’s listen port.
- Update: Program.cs
  - If `--urls` or `ASPNETCORE_URLS` is set, do nothing (honor user config).
  - Else call `builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(opts => opts.ListenAnyIP(PortAllocator.GetAvailablePort(5000)));`
  - Log “Listening on http://localhost:{port}” for clarity.
- Update: Program.cs
  - Same change as OrderService.

Notes:
- This sets a single HTTP port per service (incremental from 5000). If you prefer also allocating HTTPS (e.g., 5001, 5003…), I can extend it to pick an adjacent port for HTTPS as well.
- You can still explicitly run on a fixed port with:
  - Env: `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5050`
  - CLI: `dotnet run --urls http://localhost:5050`

If this looks good, I’ll implement steps 2–4 and then smoke-run both services to confirm they bind to 5000 and 5001 respectively.
